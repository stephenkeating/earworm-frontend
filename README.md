Short Description:
* Earworm is a 'name that tune' game built with React and Ruby on Rails. The biggest technical hurdle I overcame on this project was writing a custom algorithm for matching user guess with track titles. 

Tech Used:
* React.js
* Spotify APIs
* PostgreSQL
* Ruby on Rails API
* Custom HTML/CSS
* Jaro-Winkler algorithm

Difficult:
* String matching for guesses
* Spotify APIs

Additional Features to Add:
* Autoplay (Spotify SDK)
* Allow User to Import Playlists
* Multiplayer
* More string matching
* Data mining, such as statistics per play/track. (I have the data, just need to display it)
